## The purpose of this project is as follows:
This is my seleniums tools class file that holds my operation wrappers for all selenium actions. 
## Here's some back story on why I needed to build this:
This file is required to support the web-based automations I've put together in selenium in a consistent way. Importing the class that includes all of the methods gives child classes `self.` access to methods and eliminates code repetition. 
## This project leverages the following libraries:
selenium, webdriver_manager
## This project does not require any special setup steps.

## The expected frequency for running this code is as follows:
As Needed
